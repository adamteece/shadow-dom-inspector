# Shadow DOM Inspector Extension

A powerful browser extension designed to help debug Pendo tracking issues by inspecting elements and their Shadow DOM details.

## üéØ Purpose

This extension is specifically designed to help identify why Pendo might not be tracking clicks on certain elements. Often, clicks that appear to be on a regular DOM element are actually happening on Shadow DOM elements, which can cause tracking issues.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Element Inspection**: Click on any element to see detailed information
- **Shadow DOM Detection**: Automatically detects and displays Shadow DOM details
- **Comprehensive Element Info**: Shows tag names, IDs, classes, attributes, and key CSS properties
- **Shadow DOM Children**: Lists all child elements within Shadow DOM
- **Visual Highlighting**: Highlights inspected elements for easy identification
- **Pendo-Specific Insights**: Provides context about why elements might not be tracked

## üöÄ Installation

### For Chrome/Edge:

1. Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the folder containing this extension
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### For Firefox:

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
2. Click "This Firefox"
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Select the `manifest.json` file from this folder
5. The extension will be loaded temporarily

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Activate Inspector**: Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar and click "Start Inspecting"
2. **Inspect Elements**: Click on any element on the webpage you want to inspect
3. **View Details**: A detailed inspector panel will appear showing:
   - Element tag, ID, classes, and attributes
   - Key CSS properties that affect visibility and interaction
   - Shadow DOM information (if present)
   - All Shadow DOM child elements
4. **Understand Tracking Issues**: The extension provides specific insights about why Pendo might not track certain elements

## üîç Understanding the Results

### Regular DOM Elements
- Shows standard HTML attributes and properties
- Displays computed styles that affect element interaction

### Shadow DOM Elements
- **Shadow Root Mode**: Shows if it's "open" or "closed"
- **Child Elements**: Lists all elements inside the Shadow DOM
- **Tracking Insight**: Explains why these elements might not be tracked by Pendo

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Pendo Tracking Issues

This extension helps identify these common scenarios:

1. **Shadow DOM Clicks**: The actual click target is inside a Shadow DOM, not the visible element
2. **Pointer Events**: Elements with `pointer-events: none` won't receive clicks
3. **Invisible Elements**: Elements with `opacity: 0` or `visibility: hidden`
4. **Layered Elements**: Elements covered by other elements with higher z-index

## üé® Features Highlights

- **Real-time Inspection**: Hover over elements to see them highlighted
- **Comprehensive Data**: Shows all relevant information for debugging
- **Clean Interface**: Easy-to-read inspector panel
- **Shadow DOM Visualization**: Clear display of Shadow DOM structure
- **Pendo-Specific Tips**: Contextual help for tracking issues

## üìù Tips for Pendo Users

1. **Check Shadow DOM**: If an element isn't being tracked, check if it has Shadow DOM children
2. **Verify Pointer Events**: Ensure the element can receive pointer events
3. **Check Element Hierarchy**: Sometimes the trackable element is a parent or child
4. **Test Click Targets**: Use the extension to see exactly which element receives clicks

## üîß Technical Details

- **Manifest Version**: 3 (Chrome Extension Manifest V3)
- **Permissions**: Only requires `activeTab` and `scripting` permissions
- **Compatibility**: Works with all modern browsers that support Manifest V3
- **Performance**: Lightweight with minimal impact on page performance

1. Make sure you've enabled "Developer mode" in your browser's extension settings
